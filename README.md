# cookiecutter-typescript

## Features

`Typescript`, `Prettier`, `ESLint`, `Jest`, `CDK`

CDK generates a typescript starter for you. This is a modified version of that according to my own preferences.

## Installation

Install cookiecutter:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

Create a new repo from this template

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/liammurray/cookiecutter-typescript-cdk.git
cd <project>
make utest
make dist
./run
```

Local (e.g. clone to test and make updates)

```bash
cookiecutter /path/to/cookiecutter-typecript
```
